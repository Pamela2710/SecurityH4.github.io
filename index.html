                <p class="text-white mt-0">In your design, you must provide a list of the data that you need to collect for the operation of the application.
                    For each, provide a description of why you need this data.
                    Examples:
                </p>

                <br>
                <ul class="text-white mt-0">
                    <li class="fw-bold">Who are the users of your application? What kind of information do you need of each of them? </li>
                    <p>The application is aimed at people with safe transportation needs, who have access to digital
                        media and an internet connection. On the other hand, the application is also aimed at people
                        with access to a means of transportation who are looking for flexible opportunities to generate
                        income from their transportation service. </p>
                    <li class="fw-bold">What data do you need to make the user experience better? Examples: better ride experience, shorter wait time, faster routes, etc</li>
                    <p>Historical ride data as well as user behaviour data could be of great use to predict, based on
                        time of day and location, where a user might be headed. This could enhance the user experience
                        by suggesting the more likely destinations a rider might be in need of.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Demand heat maps would greatly benefit the drivers by providing an overlook of places that have a
                        high demand of rides based on time of the day. This would allow for drivers to supply said
                        demand properly rather than staying on an area of relatively low activity. Likewise, earnings
                        data could provide drivers with an accurate summary of their earnings based on location, time,
                        etc., allowing them to plan their day strategically.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Finally, real-time traffic data, and route optimization data would allow for a better
                        optimization of the ride, meaning shorter wait times, less time in traffic, and reducing time
                        costs which is beneficial to both the rider and the driver</p>
                    <li class="fw-bold">What kind of data do you need to collect to measure the performance and efficiency of the application?</li>
                    <p>Measuring performance and efficiency could be done by observing some key indicators. It's
                        important to have a responsive applications, users would stop using it if it had long load times
                        or if it crashed often. Travel and wait time as well as distance traveled as an indicator of
                        route selection algorithms is valuable as well.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Tracking of cancellation reasons could be a key indicator of why people are choosing to not use
                        the service and might uncover potential areas of improvement. Which coupled with usage
                        frequency, retention rates, and peak usage times could help improve user engagement metrics.</p>
                    <li class="fw-bold">What about payment and tipping?</li>
                    <p>Handling of payment, be it billing or tipping, requires the implementation of secure payment
                        services. Strong security measures are usually bundled within the chosen services and are
                        crucial when keeping financial information safe. This information tends to be credit card
                        details, billing addresses, trip and tip information such as cost, fees, and any extra charges.

            <p>Some of this data, like route and time taken, cost, and payment method, only partially, should only be

                    <br>

                        databases of stolen credentials, or attempting to steal session tokens.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To admins, it's the same case as users, but adding social engineering to obtain administrator's

                    <br>

                        Likewise, it could result in identity theft and/or financial loss for the affected user.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To admins, a breach could represent widespread identity theft and fraud. Which in turn would

                    <br>

            <h3 class="text-center mt-0">Pen-Testing Exercise</h3>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                To ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the user data being shared with advertisers, a comprehensive pen-testing exercise was conducted. This exercise aims to identify potential vulnerabilities within the new data-sharing framework and propose mitigation strategies.
            </p>
            <div class="pen-testing-details">
                <h4 class="text-center mt-0">Objective</h4>
                <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                    The objective of the pen-testing exercise is to assess the security of the new data-sharing processes, evaluate the risks they might pose to user privacy, and determine the resilience of the system against attempts to de-anonymize the data.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-center mt-0">Methodology</h4>
                <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                    The methodology included simulated attacks targeting the anonymization and aggregation processes, opt-in mechanisms, and the data management platform. Ethical hackers attempted to breach the simulated environment using a variety of techniques, including but not limited to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attempting to correlate anonymized data with external data sources to test the effectiveness of anonymization.</li>
                        <li>Exploiting potential weaknesses in the opt-in mechanism that could lead to unauthorized sharing of data.</li>
                        <li>Assessing the security measures of the data management platform for any misconfiguration or vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-center mt-0">Potential Attack Vectors</h4>
                <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                    Several potential attack vectors were identified during the pen-testing exercise, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Social engineering tactics designed to deceive users into granting unnecessary data access.</li>
                        <li>Exploiting system vulnerabilities to access data beyond the advertiser's tiered permissions.</li>
                        <li>Attempted injection attacks on the data management platform that could lead to unauthorized data modification or extraction.</li>
                    </ul>
                    After identifying these vectors, the team worked on reinforcing the security measures and developing strategies to mitigate these risks.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-center mt-0">Reporting and Mitigation</h4>
                <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                    The findings from the pen-testing exercise were thoroughly documented, detailing each vulnerability and the potential impact on user privacy. Recommendations were made to strengthen data anonymization methods, enhance the security protocols of the data sharing process, and reinforce the opt-in mechanism. Continuous monitoring and regular re-assessment were also proposed to ensure ongoing data protection.

        <!-- Ethical Analysis of Selling Data -->
        <div class="ethical-analysis">
            <h3 class="text-center mt-0">Ethical Analysis</h3>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">A critical examination of the implications of selling user data to advertisers on users and the company.</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                Selling user data raises profound ethical questions, particularly concerning user privacy and the potential misuse of personal information. When users sign up for a drive-sharing service, they entrust the company with sensitive data under the assumption that it will be used solely to improve the service. The decision to monetize this data by selling it to advertisers can be seen as a breach of this trust, especially if done without clear and explicit user consent.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                Ethical considerations must be at the forefront of the decision to sell data. Transparency with users about what data is being sold, how it is anonymized, and who it is sold to is crucial. Users should have the ability to opt-out of data selling without any penalties or degradation of service quality. Furthermore, the company must consider the broader implications of such a practice, including the possibility of data being used to discriminate or unduly influence users.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                Legally, the company is bound to adhere to data protection laws such as GDPR, which mandates strict guidelines on user consent and data handling. Ethically, the company must go beyond mere legal compliance to uphold a standard of integrity and respect for user autonomy. The potential for reputational damage is significant if users feel their data is being mishandled. In the worst-case scenario, mishandled data could lead to identity theft, financial loss, and personal harm to the users, with corresponding legal repercussions for the company.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                Therefore, the ethical sale of data requires a balance between commercial interests and the protection of user rights. This balance can be achieved by implementing robust privacy protections, maintaining high standards of data security, and fostering a culture of respect for user privacy within the company. It is not only about protecting the company from legal consequences but also about preserving the trust and loyalty of its user base.
