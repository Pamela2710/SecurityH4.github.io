                <p class="text-white mt-0">In your design, you must provide a list of the data that you need to collect for the operation of the application.
                    For each, provide a description of why you need this data.
                    Examples:
                </p>

                <br>
                <ul class="text-white mt-0">
                    <li class="fw-bold">Who are the users of your application? What kind of information do you need of each of them? </li>
                    <p>The application is aimed at people with safe transportation needs, who have access to digital
                        media and an internet connection. On the other hand, the application is also aimed at people
                        with access to a means of transportation who are looking for flexible opportunities to generate
                        income from their transportation service. </p>
                    <li class="fw-bold">What data do you need to make the user experience better? Examples: better ride experience, shorter wait time, faster routes, etc</li>
                    <p>Historical ride data as well as user behaviour data could be of great use to predict, based on
                        time of day and location, where a user might be headed. This could enhance the user experience
                        by suggesting the more likely destinations a rider might be in need of.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Demand heat maps would greatly benefit the drivers by providing an overlook of places that have a
                        high demand of rides based on time of the day. This would allow for drivers to supply said
                        demand properly rather than staying on an area of relatively low activity. Likewise, earnings
                        data could provide drivers with an accurate summary of their earnings based on location, time,
                        etc., allowing them to plan their day strategically.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Finally, real-time traffic data, and route optimization data would allow for a better
                        optimization of the ride, meaning shorter wait times, less time in traffic, and reducing time
                        costs which is beneficial to both the rider and the driver</p>
                    <li class="fw-bold">What kind of data do you need to collect to measure the performance and efficiency of the application?</li>
                    <p>Measuring performance and efficiency could be done by observing some key indicators. It's
                        important to have a responsive applications, users would stop using it if it had long load times
                        or if it crashed often. Travel and wait time as well as distance traveled as an indicator of
                        route selection algorithms is valuable as well.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Tracking of cancellation reasons could be a key indicator of why people are choosing to not use
                        the service and might uncover potential areas of improvement. Which coupled with usage
                        frequency, retention rates, and peak usage times could help improve user engagement metrics.</p>
                    <li class="fw-bold">What about payment and tipping?</li>
                    <p>Handling of payment, be it billing or tipping, requires the implementation of secure payment
                        services. Strong security measures are usually bundled within the chosen services and are
                        crucial when keeping financial information safe. This information tends to be credit card
                        details, billing addresses, trip and tip information such as cost, fees, and any extra charges.

            <br>
            <p>Likewise, driver sensitive data like driver's license and earnings should only be freely available to the

                driver when there's an ongoing trip.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of this data, like route and time taken, cost, and payment method, only partially, should only be
                seen by support personnel when requested by a driver or rider. For example, when dealing with a support
                ticket submitted by a user.</p>
            <li class="fw-bold">What information should not be seen by anyone?</li>
            <p>Financial information is a critical point here, full details of credit cards and/or accounts should only

                history should be only available to riders and drivers, protected with end-to-end encryption.</p>

                    <li class="fw-bold">What are the risks if you are able to get access to the app as a user, as an admin, and as developer?</li>
                    <p>As a user, frequently visited addresses, payment information, and contact information.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As an admin, this could mean access to complete user profiles, financial information, permissions

                    <p>To users, the attacker can perform phishing attacks with malicious websites, testing with
                        databases of stolen credentials, or attempting to steal session tokens.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To admins, it's the same case as users, but adding social engineering to obtain administrator's
                        credentials, or bribing one into misusing their access.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To developers, the attacker could try to exploit insecure developer tools or endpoints, such as
                        code injection, or looking for misconfigured access controls and permissions.</p>

                    <p>To users, this could represent a threat to personal safety if their trip data is leaked.
                        Likewise, it could result in identity theft and/or financial loss for the affected user.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To admins, a breach could represent widespread identity theft and fraud. Which in turn would
                        cause the people in charge of the app to face regulatory fines and legal action.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To developers, the breach would see the possibility of systematic failure and widespread
                        unauthorized data access. This could be used to launch further attacks on users, cascading
                        into the issues described for users and admins. A vulnerability of this magnitude would have
                        severe legal and financial repercussions.</p>
